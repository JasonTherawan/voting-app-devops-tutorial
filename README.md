## CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflow file is located at:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

It will:
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Optionally run tests (can be extended)
- Ensure build success before allowing deployment

The pipeline is automatically triggered on:
- `push` to any branch
- Pull requests
